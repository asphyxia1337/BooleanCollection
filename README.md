# BooleanCollection

> **"Because a single boolean is simply not enough."**

## 🤯 What is BooleanCollection?
BooleanCollection is the ultimate library for those who have outgrown the traditional, restrictive world of `true` and `false`. Why settle for binary logic when you can have **MutantBoolean**, **CreepyBoolean**, **BigBoolean**, and more? This is not just a library—it's a revolution in boolean technology.

## 🛠 Features
- 🏋️ **BigBoolean** – Because sometimes a single bit just isn't enough.
- 👀 **CreepyBoolean** – It always watches, but it never tells the truth.
- 🔒 **ImmutableBoolean** – Set it once, regret it forever.
- 🧬 **MutantBoolean** – It has two values. Which one wins? Who knows.
- 🐱 **SchrödingerBoolean** – A boolean that is both `true` and `false` until observed.
- 💾 DiskBoolean – A boolean that persists... even when you don't want it to.

And more to come...

## ⚠️ Warnings
- Using **BigBoolean** may consume more memory than expected. Maybe **a lot** more.
- Prolonged exposure to **CreepyBoolean** may cause paranoia.
- If **SchrödingerBoolean** returns `maybe`, you have unlocked a forbidden state. Seek shelter immediately.
- **MutantBoolean** is unstable. Use at your own risk.

## 🎩 Who is this for?
- Developers who find `boolean` **too limiting**.
- Programmers who believe logic should be **less logical**.
- Engineers who enjoy **chaos and uncertainty**.
